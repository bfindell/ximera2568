three variables is given.  For each equation write the subspace of solutions
in $\R^3$ as the span of two vectors in $\R^3$.

$(1,1,0)^t$ and $(-3,0,1)^t$.

\soln All solutions to $x - y + 3z = 0$ can be written in the form

$B = \left(\begin{array}{rrrrrr} 1 & -1 & 0 & 5 & 0 & 0\\
        0 & 0 & 1 & 2 & 0 & 2\\
        0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 2\end{array}\right)$.

\begin{solution}

\ans The subspace of solutions to $Bx = 0$ is spanned by the vectors
\[
\left(\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ 1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right), \quad

\exerciselabel{9}{5.2}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.2.3}
Write a system of two linear equations of the form $Ax=0$ where
$A$ is a $2\times 4$ matrix whose subspace of solutions in $\R^4$
is the span of the two vectors
\[
v_1 = \left(\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\  0 \end{array}\right) \AND
v_2 = \left(\begin{array}{r} 0 \\  0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right).
\]

\begin{solution}

\ans The matrix $A$ whose subspace of solutions in $\R^4$ is the span of
$v_1$ and $v_2$ is
\[
A = \left(\begin{array}{rrrr} 1 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 1
\end{array}\right).
\]

\soln Note that all vectors $x$ in the spanning set of $v_1$ and $v_2$
are of the form:
\[
x = \left(\begin{array}{r} x_1 \\ x_2 \\ x_3 \\ x_4
\end{array}\right)
= a\left(\begin{array}{r} 1 \\ -1 \\ 0 \\ 0 \end{array}\right) + 
b\left(\begin{array}{r} 0 \\ 0 \\ 1 \\ -1 \end{array}\right) =
\left(\begin{array}{r} a \\ -a \\ b \\ -b \end{array}\right).
\]
Therefore, $x_1 = -x_2$ and $x_3 = -x_4$.  So,
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrrrrrl}
x_1 & + & x_2 & & & & & = & 0 \\
& & & & x_3 & + & x_4 & = & 0. \end{array}
\]
The matrix of this system is $A$.

\problemlabel

\exerciselabel{15}{5.2}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.2.5}
Is $(2,20,0)$ in the span of $w_1=(1,1,3)$ and $w_2=(1,4,2)$?
Answer this question by setting up a system of linear equations
and solving that system by row reducing the associated augmented
matrix\index{matrix!augmented}.

\begin{solution}

\ans The vector $(2,20,0)^t$ is in the span of $w_1$ and $w_2$. 
Specifically, $v = -4w_1 + 6w_2$.

\soln Note that, for some real numbers $a$ and $b$,
\[
(2,20,0)^t = aw_1 + bw_2 = a(1,1,3)^t + b(1,4,2)^t
\]
if $v$ is in the span of $w_1$ and $w_2$.
This corresponds to the linear system
\[
\begin{array}{rrrrr}
a & + & b & = 2 \\
a & + & 4b & = 20 \\
3a & + & 2b & = 0 \end{array}
\]
To find $a$ and $b$, row reduce the augmented matrix of the system:
\[
\left(\begin{array}{rr|r} 1 & 1 & 2 \\ 1 & 4 & 20 \\
3 & 2 & 0 \end{array}\right) \longrightarrow
\left(\begin{array}{rr|r} 1 & 0 & -4 \\ 0 & 1 & 6 \\
0 & 0 & 0 \end{array}\right).
\]
The system is consistent; $a = -4$ and $b = 6$.

\problemlabel

\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c5.2.6a} -- \ref{c5.2.6d} let $W\subset\CCone$
be the subspace spanned by the two polynomials $x_1(t) = 1$ and
$x_2(t)=t^2$.  For the given function $y(t)$ decide whether or not $y(t)$
is an element of $W$.  Furthermore, if $y(t)\in W$, determine whether the set
$\{y(t),x_2(t)\}$ is a spanning set for $W$.


\exerciselabel{16}{5.2}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.2.6a}
$y(t) = 1-t^2$,

\begin{solution}

\ans The function $y(t) = 1 - t^2$ is an element of $W$ and the set
$\{y(t),x_2(t)\}$ is a spanning set for $W$.



\soln The space $W$ equals $\Span\{x_1(t),x_2(t)\}$ where $x_1(t)=1$ and 
$x_2(t)=t^2$.  To show that $y(t)$ is an element of $W$, let
$a = 1$ and $b = -1$, and compute
\[
ax_1(t) + bx_2(t) = x_1(t) - x_2(t) = 1 - t^2 = y(t). 
\]
To show that $\{y(t),x_2(t)\}$ is a spanning set for $W$, rewrite every
linear combination of $x_1(t)$ and $x_2(t)$ in terms of $y(t)$ and $x_2(t)$, 
as follows:
\[ 
ax_1(t) + bx_2(t) = a + bt^2 = a(1 - t^2) + (a + b)t^2
= ay(t) + (a + b)x_2(t). 
\]

\end{solution}

\exerciselabel{25}{5.2}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.2.10}
Let $Ax=b$ be a system of $m$ linear equations in $n$ unknowns,
and let $r=\rank(A)$ and $s=\rank(A|b)$.  Suppose that this system
has a unique solution.  What can you say about the relative
magnitudes of $m,n,r,s$?

\begin{solution}

\ans The relationship of the constants is $m \geq n = r = s$.

\soln The rank of matrix $A$ cannot be greater than the rank of matrix
$(A|b)$, since $(A|b)$ consists of $A$ plus one column.  The rank of $A$
is the number of pivots in the row reduced matrix.  $(A|b)$ can be row 
reduced through the same operations, and will have either the same number
of pivots as $A$ or, if there is a pivot in the last column, one more
pivot than $A$.  Since the system has a unique solution, it is consistent,
and therefore $(A|b)$ cannot have a pivot in the $(n + 1)^{st}$ column, so
$r = \rank(A) = \rank(A|b) = s$.

\para The set of solutions is parameterized by $n - r$ parameters,
where $n$ is the number of columns of $A$.  Since there is a unique
solution, the set of solutions is parameterized by $0$ parameters,
so $n = r$.

\para The number $m$ of rows of the matrix must be greater than or
equal to $n$ in order for the system to have a unique solution, since
there must be $n$ pivots, and each pivot must be in a separate row.



\end{solution}
