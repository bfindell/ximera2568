\problemlabel

\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c5.1.4a} -- \ref{c5.1.4f} you are given a
vector space $V$ and a subset $W$.  For each pair, decide whether or
not $W$ is a subspace of $V$, and explain why.


\exerciselabel{4}{5.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4a}
$V=\R^3$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^3$
     that have a $0$ in their first component.

\begin{solution}
$W$ is a subspace of $V$, since $W$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\exerciselabel{5}{5.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4b}
$V=\R^3$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^3$
     that have a $1$ in their first component.

\begin{solution}
\ans $W$ is not a subspace of $V$.

\soln The subset $W$ is closed neither under addition nor under scalar
multiplication.  For example, let $w_1 = (1,4,2)$ and $w_2 = (1,-1,3)$
be elements of $W$.  Then,
\[
w_1 + w_2 = (1,4,2) + (1,-1,3) = (2,3,5)
\]
which is not an element of $W$.


\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\problemlabel

\exerciselabel{7}{5.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4c}
$V=\R^2$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^2$
     for which the sum of the components is $0$.

\begin{solution}
$W$ is a subspace of $V$, since $W$ is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\problemlabel

\exerciselabel{6}{5.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.4d}
$V=\R^2$ and $W$ consists of vectors in $\R^2$
     for which the sum of the components is $1$.

\begin{solution}
\ans $W$ is not a subspace of $V$.

\soln The subset $W$ is closed neither under addition nor under scalar
multiplication.  For example, let $w_1 = (3,-2)$ and $w_2 = (0,1)$ be
elements of $W$.  Then,
\[
w_1 + w_2 = (3,-2) + (0,1) = (3,-3).
\]
The sum of the elements $3 - 3 = 0 \neq 1$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}

\problemlabel

\noindent In Exercises~\ref{c5.1.5a} -- \ref{c5.1.5e} which of the
sets $S$ are subspaces?


\exerciselabel{14}{5.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.5d}
$S = \{x\in\R^2: Ax=0\}$ where $A$ is a $3\times 2$ matrix.

\begin{solution}
The set $S$ is a subspace, since it is closed under
addition and scalar multiplication.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}


%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%


\problemlabel

\exerciselabel{15}{5.1}\begin{exercise} \label{c5.1.5e}
$S = \{x\in\R^2: Ax=b\}$ where $A$ is a $3\times 2$ matrix
	and $b\in\R^3$ is a fixed nonzero vector.

\begin{solution}
\ans The set $S$ is not a subspace.

\soln The set $S$ is closed under neither addition nor scalar
multiplication.  For example, let $x_1$ and $x_2$ be solutions to the
equation $Ax = b$.  Then,
\[
A(x_1 + x_2) = Ax_1 + Ax_2 = b + b = 2b,
\]
so $(x_1 + x_2)$ is not an element of $S$.

\end{solution}
\end{exercise}
